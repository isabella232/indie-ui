		<p>UIRequestEvents initiate from the element representing the point-of-regard, and are referenced in the Event object's <code>target</code> property.</p>
		<p>For mainstream user agents, the point-of-regard will likely be the element under a pointer (e.g. mouse cursor) or, in the case of keyboard events, the currently focused element (e.g. document.activeElement). Assistive technologies or other alternative inputs may determine another element to be the subject of the user's attention, and initiate events from this new point-of-regard.</p>

		<p class="ednote">Need to explain difference between the event.target, the element handling the event (addEventListener), and the "receiver" of the UIRequestEvent. The event "receiver" will be author-defined with an attribute (potentially @actions or @ui-actions) that describes the type of UI actions that can be performed on the element (the UIRequestEvent "receiver") as is a contract declaration of the types of UIRequestEvents that will be received and handled by the web application.</p>
