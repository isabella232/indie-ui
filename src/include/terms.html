		<p class="ednote">Depending on the context, this is either the element under the pointer (e.g. mouse cursor), the currently focused element (document.activeElement), or an element that the assistive technology determines to be the subject of the user's attention. UIRequestEvents initiate from the element representing the point-of-regard, and are referenced in the Event object's <code>target</code> property.</p>

	<dd>Attributes whose DOM property and content attribute values remain in sync. Identical to <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/common-dom-interfaces.html#reflect" class="todo">reflected attributes in HTML</a>.</dd>

	<dd class="placeholder">
		TBD
		<p class="ednote">Need to explain difference between the event.target, the element handling the event (addEventListener), and the "receiver" of the UIRequestEvent. The event "receiver" will be author-defined with an attribute (potentially @actions or @ui-actions) that describes the type of UI actions that can be performed on the element (the UIRequestEvent "receiver") as is a contract declaration of the types of UIRequestEvents that will be received and handled by the web application.</p>
